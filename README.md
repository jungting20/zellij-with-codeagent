# Zellij Agent Runtime

`zellij-with-codeagent` is an MVP Go runtime that lets an agent manage Zellij panes through a daemon-owned boundary. Zellij remains the terminal execution fabric, but `agentd` owns logical pane IDs, registry state, subscriptions, events, reconciliation, cleanup, and introspection.

## Current MVP

- `cmd/agentd` starts the daemon skeleton and wires the in-process runtime service.
- `internal/runtime.RuntimeService` is the primary boundary for callers and future planners.
- `internal/zellij` is the only package that shells out to the Zellij CLI.
- `internal/registry` is the system of record for daemon-managed panes.
- `internal/eventbus` publishes normalized runtime events and retains recent event history.
- `internal/supervisor` builds a read-only status view from runtime introspection.

There is no external API transport yet. Callers should use the Go service boundary in tests or future in-process integrations.

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or newer
- Zellij installed and available as `zellij`
- A running Zellij environment for integration or E2E tests

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Start the current daemon entrypoint:

```bash
go run ./cmd/agentd
```

The entrypoint currently prints `agentd daemon skeleton`; it initializes the runtime service but does not expose HTTP, Unix socket, stdio JSON-RPC, gRPC, or a human CLI.

## Runtime Service Shape

Future planners and developer harnesses should call `RuntimeService`, not Zellij directly:

```go
service := runtime.NewService(runtime.Options{
    Registry:           registry.New(),
    Backend:            zellij.NewBackend(zellij.Options{}),
    SubscriptionRunner: runtime.ExecSubscriptionRunner{},
})

created, err := service.CreatePane(ctx, runtime.CreatePaneRequest{
    ID:      "pane-1",
    TaskID:  "task-1",
    Role:    runtime.PaneRoleTest,
    Command: []string{"go", "test", "./..."},
})
```

The core operations are:

- `CreatePane`, `SendInput`, `SnapshotOutput`, and `ClosePane` for managed pane control.
- `SubscribeEvents` and `RecentEvents` for raw output, semantic matcher events, pane close events, subscribe errors, and health changes.
- `InspectPane`, `ListPanes`, and `InspectRuntime` for current daemon-owned state.
- `Reconcile` to align registry state with live Zellij pane metadata.
- `Cleanup` to close daemon-managed panes while preserving unmanaged panes in the same session.

## Zellij Session Selection

`zellij.NewBackend(zellij.Options{Session: "name"})` adds `--session name` to Zellij CLI calls. Tests also honor `ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME` for real-Zellij integration and E2E runs:

```bash
ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME=my-session AGENTD_ZELLIJ_INTEGRATION=1 go test ./internal/runtime -run '^TestIntegration' -v -count=1
```

When no session is configured, the backend lets Zellij use its default session behavior.

## Manual Verification

Automatic real-Zellij integration tests create panes and clean them up:

```bash
AGENTD_ZELLIJ_INTEGRATION=1 go test ./internal/runtime -run '^TestIntegration' -v -count=1
```

Manual E2E tests intentionally leave panes open for observation:

```bash
AGENTD_ZELLIJ_E2E=1 go test ./internal/runtime -run '^TestE2ECreateTabAndFourPanesPrintRegistry$' -v -count=1
```

See `docs/runtime-e2e-test.md` for the close-on-input E2E flow and cleanup notes.

## Invariants

- Planners and clients must not invoke Zellij directly. They request outcomes through `RuntimeService`.
- `agentd` is the only owner of Zellij mutations for managed panes: create, input, subscribe, snapshot, reconcile, close, and cleanup.
- Logical `PaneID` values are daemon-owned and stable. Zellij pane IDs are backend identifiers and may disappear or be reused.
- The registry is the system of record for managed runtime state. Zellij is the execution runtime, not the durable state source.
- Unmanaged live Zellij panes may be reported by reconciliation, but they are not adopted or closed by default.
- Subscription lifecycles must follow pane lifecycles. Lost, exited, closed, and cleanup-closed panes should not keep subscribe processes alive.
- Debug views and future transports should expose the same runtime state that planner integrations use.

## Current Limitations

- Local-only, in-memory runtime state.
- No restart persistence beyond what can be rediscovered through reconciliation.
- Rule-based semantic event matchers only.
- No LLM planner integration yet.
- No external transport or rich TUI dashboard yet.
